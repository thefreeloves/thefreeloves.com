Hey Tony,

I'll get the ball rolling first.
I like the black back ground, with TFL logo and a photo
Pretty plain and easy to navigate
Maybe with upcoming events or news thing there if you scroll down
Menu I would like to see
Upcoming events
Members
Media
Merchandise 
Contact 

I would like the ability to listen to music, either via Soundcloud Link or YouTube clip 

All other stuff I don't care about,
Just want it to look good on a phone and be modern

Over too you guys...
