In late 2014, three best friends from Marburg, Queensland were asked to get some songs together and play
at a local festival. The crowd response was overwhelming and with this just scratching the surface, they
started their most amazing musical adventure......The Free Loves.

The Free Loves consists of seasoned musicians Greg McHugh, Athol Birnie and Rob Hawley. Having
played with each other in different bands for over 15 years, this is the first time all three have played
together. Between them, they have performed in venues and festivals throughout Australia and New
Zealand, such as, Woodford Folk Festival, Rhythm and Vines Festival (NZ), Brisbane Folk Festival, Byron
Bay Blues Festival and GrottoFest, to name a few.

The Free Loves music has been described as
“ Big three part harmonies, big dirty fuzz tones and driving beats”
The band is constantly praised by others for sounding unique and having a high energy live show that is
infectious.

The Free Loves are currently recording a three song EP, due for release in Jan/Feb 2016. The songs are
being mixed by John Hudson, a grammy award winning mixing engineer, from Mayfair Studios in London,
UK. They plan to distribute this to radio stations and apply for many festivals. Their music is ready for
some big crowds.

A national tour of Australia is first on the agenda once the EP has been released and recording of a full
length album will commence in mid 2016. A tour of New Zealand is planned for 2017, joining the nations
festival circuit.

The Free Loves are going to achieve big things.
Three best mates doing what they love, to people who love music.
The Free Loves would love to work with you, lets do it!
